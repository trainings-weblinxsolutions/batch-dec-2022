## Assignments


### Assignment 8
**To Do**
1. Go through the lectures, notes and programs on creating classes,objects and methods.
2. Create a class Employee,
	* With age, salaryPerDay and noOfDaysWorking attributes
	* A method to compute monthly salary, which will return the monthly salary which is calculated as salaryPerDay*noOfDaysWorking
	* If age is >40, add an extra bonus of 100 per working day to the monthly salary. If age is >60, add an extra bonus of 200 per working day to the monthly salary.
	* Create multiple employees with the following data. (Values are comma separated - first value is age, second is salaryPerDay, third is noOfDaysWorking)
		*  employee1 - (26, 1000, 27)
		*  employee2 - (39, 1250, 25)
		*  employee3 - (41, 1100, 29)
		*  employee4 - (53, 1050, 26)
		*  employee5 - (62, 1150, 24)
	* Print out the monthly salary for each employee.
	

### Assignment 7
**To Do**
1. Go through the arrays lecture, notes and programs.
2. Create an array with elements {7,8,1,3,41,2,9,5,12,6,4,16}. Fin out the maximum and minimum number in the array.
3. Write a program to check if two arrays are equal or not. Eg 1: array1  = {2,3,4,5} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be true. Eg 2: array1  = {2,3,4,6} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be false.
4. Write a program to find the sum of numbers at even and odd indices in array and then print out the which sum is the greatest.
	* Eg: array = {4,5,2,8,3,6}
	* Sum at even indices = 4+2+3 = 9 (4 is at index 0, 2 is at index 2, 3 is at index 4)
	* Sum at odd  indices = 5+8+6 = 19 (5 is at index 1, 8 is at index 3, 6 is at index 5)
	* O/p should be: Sum at odd indices is greatest.
